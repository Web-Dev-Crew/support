## FAQs

- **What is a GitHub Organization?** Essentially it's a way to group many repositories in an entity called an organization. An organization also allows us to group people who contribute and are a part of the community. Some examples would be - [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix), [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook), and [EddieHub](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity).
